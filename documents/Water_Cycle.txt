The Water Cycle

The water cycle is the journey water takes as it moves around our planet. It is also called the hydrologic cycle. This cycle has several main parts:

1. Evaporation:
Water from oceans, lakes, and rivers heats up from the sun and turns into water vapor. This is called evaporation.

2. Condensation:
The water vapor rises into the sky and cools down, turning into tiny water droplets. These droplets come together to form clouds.

3. Precipitation:
When the clouds get heavy, the water falls back to the ground as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. This is called precipitation.

4. Collection:
The water that falls collects in oceans, lakes, rivers, and the ground. Then the cycle starts all over again!

The water cycle is important because it helps give us fresh water to drink, water for plants to grow, and it keeps our weather moving.
